Final Assignment
Chris Bierley

The first part didn't say the language so I picked Python because I like the language.

by the third part I realized that was in java and hopefully it doesn't matter grading wise that I picked another language for the first part.

I this was the first time I coded a server implementation. 
I had to do a lot of research...
I ended up watching a lot of youtube video. 
Which I didn't end up using any of their code but just learned socket and other server things from them.

Hopefully this is somewhat the assignment is asking for!
